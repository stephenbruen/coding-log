# My coding Log / 100 Days of code 
<br>
# 1/2/20 4/100
<br>
This is something I wanted to started to hold my self accountable. I want to start a blog but this will be more towards the point and a quick reflection on what I coded. I'm going for the 100 days of code so this will help because people will be able to see that I skipped a day.
<br>
What I coded today was I worked on freeCodeCamp to help finish up my javascript algorithms and data certification. Mainly working on the regular expressions section and flipping between bootstrap in the front end libraries.
<br> 
I also worked on the the Javascript 30 course by Wes Bos. I project I worked on today was Flex panels Image Gallery. 
<br>

I picked back up on the JS30 course. This was the Ajax type ahead. I also continued on the freeCodeCamp. I was also researching wordpress and php. I want to start working on stadic websites for small business in my area.

Started going back to the fundamentals of JavaScript just to hammer on the basics. I really want to understand everything a good scale.I also might go back to html & css to get my understanding of those both at a deeper level. So I'm going to get a course to help dive that home. So today mainly working on javascript basics and html and css going into a deeper learning. Made a new repo for all my coding practices for Jan 2020. Hopefully will be doing one of these each month to sharpen my skills because you have to do some drills before you head to the game. Happy NFL wildcard weekend!

Hey the pats lost, which is good! Derrick Henry is amazing. I worked on two projects for the javascript 30 course. Didn't get to code as much as I wanted to. Hopefully I get to work on some more javascript 2moro. I'm also looking into doing a treehouse techdegree of a udacity program. Won't do those for a few months since I want to work on the basics a bit more.

Worked on the Javascript 30. Since starting I haven't missed a day of that yet. Which goes along with my 100 days of code challenge. Which I'm on day 8 of. I also started back on working on the budget app I started a while ago and want to finish this week. I have some de-bugging to do on the stuff I have done on it. I might just finished up the code and then debug so I can learn some de-bugging tips from online.

<br> Writing all this out as I'm doing it. I'm working on my second portfolio website. My first one was a basic one based on the freeCodeCamp one they have you do. I'm hoping to finish that today but might have to flow into 2more. I have to keep up on my js30 class, I don't want to miss a day of that so I will be doing on of the shorter ones today. The one I choose to do was working on key sequence detenction (aka the konami code). I'm taking a break from my budget app since that's kinda melting my brain at the moment. I will get that done by the end of the week though.

Doubel digits of 100 days of code! Gaining momentum now. worked on my portfolio site a bit more. Hopefully will finish it all up 2moro. I got mainly everything done, just need to clean it up a bit. This project taught me a bit more about grid and media queries which should help my css knowledge. I really want to dive deeper into css and html for the rest of jan. I will still be doing some js so I don't forget everything I've learned thus far. I might get a class on Sass since that might be a good thing to learn. I didn't get to a JS30 module today though. Work went way longer than I thought it would, 2moro should be similar in my work schedule but going to keep up coding and not missing a day!

Had a long day at work today! got to finish up the outline of my portfolio and need to add somes stuff to change it up and add in my projects. I will change it from time to time. I also need to figure out why my javascript isn't loading into my page. For some reason when I click it doesn't work which is odd. I'm not sure what's the next thing I want to work on. I think I want to dive into more html and css. So i might start my course on sass or I'll do the start of the bootcamp so I can get more practice in.

I went over some array and else / else if / if / for / while. I worked on the fizzbuzz problem. I feel like going over basics over and over again is deeping my understanding of javascript. I think building this foundation is going to be good in the long run. I should be doing the same stuff over and over until I can expalin it to anyone. I had some of that happen today where I knew what the teacher was going to say before she explained it.
<br>

<br>
I'm working on my portfolio page again, kinda updating it all. I also want to add a section to it. I'm not sure what I want to add to it. I'm also going back to my bootcamp udemy course to practice more Javascript. I may also touch on freeCodeCamp aswell today. My nfl picks are 49ers, packers, chiefs, ravens.
<br>

<br>
Today I really had a lack of motivation to code. I'm not really sure what sprung that on.. What I did today was some freeCodeCamp and working on the udemy course I have. they're mainly going over DOM which I had an okay idea of and want to dive deeper into it.

Yesterday and today I made a ton of progess on freeCodeCamp. I finished Bootstrap, Jquery, and Sass sections in the Front End Lib section. The next is react which I'm going to hold off from it for now, I don't feel super good about javascript so I don't want to start a framework just yet. I'm going to to finish up the javascript section first.
<br>

<br>
Worked on more freecodecamp. I had a long day of work today so not a ton of coding. I hope to finish all of the debugging section today. I've be doing good at fcc. I want to finsih the javascript section in the next two weeks hopefully.

Worked on more freeCodeCamp today. I mainly worked on the data structures and react portion. I want to finsh these certs in the next two months. I need to study for my mta exam so I may have to focus a bit more on that coming up on sunday. It goes over html, css, javascript and app life cycle. I will have to study for that since it cost me out of pocket and I have two tries for $80+ so I have to take it serious.
<br>

Today I worked on studying for my MTA test. This envoles looking at html,css,javascript. This test seems to go over basics and having a deep understanding of the basics. I'm going to study over the next week and take my first try next week before the end of the month. I also worked on fcc on some stuff.

Today i finished up my grid prject. I just had to touch up everything a bit. I also started on my own project it's going to be a website for call of duty league. I'm just figuring out everything with it right now. Mainly getting the html down on it. I also did some freecodecamp things today.
<br>

today i taught my junior robotics class. We made a fly that flies around and they coded it which controlled the speed and direction of the plane. I also did some more studying for my mta cert.
<br>

<br>
Today I did more test prep for MTA 98-375. Did some practice test and watched a video to learn some more basics. Learn some more html5 things I had no clue of. Mainly tables,asides, forms and much more. Some of this I knew but it went more in depth into in.
<br>

<br>
Today I did more test prep and practice exams. I'm hoping to take my first try at the test next week. I'll have two tries. I want to use my first try to learn the process of the test. I want to poistion my self to pass the first time but I will have a second attempt so hopefully that takes some pressure off me a bit. I've gotten bad test jitters recently maybe because I haven't taken a ton of test recently.
