This is something I wanted to started to hold my self accountable. I want to start a blog but this will be more towards the point and a quick reflection on what I coded. I'm going for the 100 days of code so this will help because people will be able to see that I skipped a day.
<br>
What I coded today was I worked on freeCodeCamp to help finish up my javascript algorithms and data certification. Mainly working on the regular expressions section and flipping between bootstrap in the front end libraries.
<br> 
I also worked on the the Javascript 30 course by Wes Bos. I project I worked on today was Flex panels Image Gallery.
